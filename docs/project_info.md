# Miscellaneous Project Info

## Why does this exist?

If you search around Plex forums, you'll find quite a few posts where people discuss how they organise their wrestling libraries. Mostly, these posts conclude that there isn't a great option. While WWE got some coverage in existing metadata DBs, it was often prone to being deleted at a moment's notice on the whims of the admin. While that situation seems to have alleviated of late, and weekly TV is represented in TVDB and elsewhere, the volume of wrestling available means that not everything is going to be available in a DB intended to track TV Shows and Movies, and arguably every wrestling event doesn't fit in a database like that.

My previous setup had just been to dump files in a folder and use the "Other Videos" library type in Plex, which doesn't provide any of the niceties like metadata or a nice way to sort files. Due to all the shit that happened around the business, I'd checked out of wrestling for most of 2020, and recently decided to build a new library of wrestling content to dip my toe back in. I wanted a library that looked nice, was sorted well and had metadata defined. After matching some ROH content that *was* included in TMDB, I thought building a Plex agent that could do the same for any wrestling event would be a fun project. I also had Python experience scraping CAGEMATCH for a previous project, [graplist.fm](https://github.com/gordonjb/graplist.fm), sadly abandoned around the time it turned out half my top 10 had been noncing.

## What metadata is set?

Matched items will have the following metadata set:

| Plex field           | CAGEMATCH source                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Originally Available | Date/Broadcast Date                                               | CAGEMATCH (almost) always sets it's "Date" field to the taping date. If it exists in the event info, the "Broadcast Date" field will be used, if not "Date" will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Studio               | Promotion                                                         | Allows you to filter items by promotion using the Studio field. The full text of the field (e.g. "World Wrestling Federation") will be used rather than any abbreviations. Currently if a company changes it's name, those events will not be linked together. Events in the Freelance categories will not have a Studio set.                                                                                                                                |
| Collections          | Promotion                                                         | Which collections are set depends on the library settings. Promotion collections use the same text as Studio. The full text of the field (e.g. "World Wrestling Federation") will be used rather than any abbreviations. Currently if a company changes it's name, those events will not be linked together. Events in the Freelance categories will not be added to promotion collections.                                                                  |
| Title                | Event Name/Match Card Entry                                       | Event items use the "Name of the event" field. Match items use the match text from the Card page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rating               | Current Total Rating/Matchguide Rating                            | Event items use the "Current total rating" for the event if one is present. Match items use the "Matchguide rating" if one is present. Plex ratings are always a percentage value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Roles                | All workers                                                       | Allows you to filter items by wrestler using the Actor field. Plex will also use this to show Related items. Event items add a role containing the name of each wrestler in the "All workers" section of the event page. Match items will add a role if the name in "All workers" is present in the match title. Wrestlers with multiple names (e.g. Dean Ambrose/Jon Moxley) are not currently linked together, these will be considered separate "actors". |
| Summary              | Name of the event, Promotion, Date, Location, Arena, Card/Results | A summary is generated from multiple fields for both event and match items. For events, the full card or results will also be included depending on the library settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
